				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Bikeshopcomapre.com is a comparison website that compares cycle shops across the UK.  It is the first of its kind and its aim is to help people who are passionate about cycling to find a suitable cycle shop where they can get their bike serviced or repaired.</p>
				<p>We came up with the idea after discovering a new passion for cycling, despite not knowing much about carrying out repairs or having the confidence to carry out servicing.  Trying to find a suitable cycle shop that would accommodate factors such as an ideal location, and pricing was extremely time consuming and involved phoning around a number of cycle shops in our local area.  So we thought up the idea of taking the leg work out and placing all cycle shops in one convenient location.</p>
