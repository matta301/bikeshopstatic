				<h5>Morbi facilisis iaculis accumsan.</h5>
				<p>Maintaining a healthy, road worthy bike is very important as every cyclist or bike owner should know. It makes your ride that even more enjoyable. Regular servicing and tune ups will keep you riding safely and maximise the life span of your bicycle. Avoiding regular maintenance could turn into expensive and inconvenient repairs.</p>

				<h1>WHAT IS BIKESHOPCOMPARE.COM?</h1>
				<p>Our bike Shop comparison website combines information on all cycle shops within the UK, allowing you to view and compare the best value for money bike shops within your area.</p>
				<p>Is your bike in need of a much needed service or repair?</p>
				<p>Are you looking at booking your bicycle in to a bike shop but have no idea which to choose?</p>
				<p>Whether you own a road bike, mountain bike, hybrid bike, electric bike, BMX, Tandem or any other kind of bike. There comes a point when components will start to break if they are not maintained properly or wear down though continued use.</p>
				<p>As we lead extremely busy lives it can be difficult to find the time to carryout repairs and maintenance, or we may just not have the knowledge to be able to.  Therefore when searching for a suitable bike shop that can accommodate our needs, in terms of budget and the type of services they offer, where they are located, it can be quite time consuming.</p>
